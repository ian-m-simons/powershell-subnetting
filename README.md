currently this program will calculate subnets based on the desired number of subnets, then let you create new DHCP scopes using those calculated subnets. It does not currently work with the last created subnet for example if you asked for 2 subnets and used both to create a scope, it would have problems. 

it generally works, but it is far from optimized.

eventually I want to add the ability to subnet based on the number of addresses you want per subunet.
